                Hello! I’m Aimee, and I’m a Fullstack Web Developer and Software Engineer. I love coding, traveling, Game of Thrones (we don’t talk about Season 8 here) and learning everything I can under the sun. 
                I’m a New Yorker born and raised, but spent a significant amount of my life in Washington D.C. That’s what shaped my decision to go into Tech. 
                I knew I wanted a career where I could pursue my interests and find something that would align with my values, and where I could build meaningful and creative solutions to help make people’s lives easier through innovative technologies. 
                I am both a graduate of The George Washington University and Flatiron School.
